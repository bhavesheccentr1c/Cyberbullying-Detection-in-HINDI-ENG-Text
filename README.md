# Cyberbullying-Detection-HINDI-cnn_bilstm_model
Built a deep-learning model to detect cyberbullying in code-mixed text (Romanized Hindi, Hindi, and English). Designed a CNN–BiLSTM architecture trained from scratch to handle noisy, mixed-language social-media data. Created a full preprocessing pipeline, trained the model, and evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
