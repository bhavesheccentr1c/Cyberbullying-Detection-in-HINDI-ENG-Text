# Cyberbullying Detection Model(Hindi & English)
Built a deep-learning model to detect cyberbullying in code-mixed text (Romanized Hindi, Hindi, and English). The project uses a CNN–BiLSTM architecture trained from scratch to effectively handle noisy, multilingual social-media data. It includes a complete preprocessing pipeline, and the model’s performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
